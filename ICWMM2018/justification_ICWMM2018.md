I have been invited by the 51st International Conference On Water Management Modeling to present one of my recent works, "Breaking bad: a robust breakout detection method based on E-Divisive with Medians (EDM) for modeling data quality control", which abstract has already been accepted and the whole paper will be published in the Journal of Water Management Modeling. Hosted by Computational Hydraulics International (CHI), the conference is a leading conference worldwide providing a great opportunity for H&H modelers, engineering professionals, research scientists, and government policy makers to exchange ideas on current practices and emerging technologies in water management. I believe it's a great opportunity to demonstrate our strength in advanced data management techniques, gain public recognition and peer review. In addition, Attending the conference could extend my knowledge in H&H modeling, which would also be beneficial to the modeling works at the Office of Watersheds in PWD.
